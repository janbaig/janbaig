## Hey there ðŸ‘¾

Iâ€™m into **compilers** and love digging into how things work under the hood. 

### Open Source Contributions
- **[Swift compiler](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift)** â€“ worked on property wrapper initialization internals, [details here](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/pull/83886).  
- **[Zag-Smalltalk](https://github.com/Zag-Research/Zag-Smalltalk)** â€“ built the core infrastructure for the [LLVM-based JIT](https://github.com/Zag-Research/Zag-Smalltalk/commits/main/?author=janbaig) for a research-based Smalltalk VM.  

Currently exploring more about compilers and LLVM, with a growing interest in ML compilers <br>
Always happy to connect and learn from others!
